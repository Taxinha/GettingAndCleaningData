### How to use the run_analysis.R script
To run the **run_analysis.R** script you will need to source the file in R or RStudio

```
> source('run_analysis.R')
```

Once you source the script, the main function will be called and will call the following functions: 
1. downloadAndExtractZipFile
2. readAndMergeTrainingAndTestSets
3. extractMeanAndSTD
4. updateActivityNames
5. tidyDataSet
6. writeTidyDataFile




### Axuxiliar Functions





When you given the variables descriptive names, explain why the names are descriptive.

### How to read the tidy data file generated by this script
Assuming the file is in the same folder as the run_analysis.R script and has the original name *tidyData.txt* you can call the function `readTidyDataFile()` to load the file

```
> tidyData <- readTidyDataFile()
```
